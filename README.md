Equipment failure is a common phenomemon in industry, which may have trivial impacts on operations or cause major catasrophies including significant loss of production or injury. Proper maintenance strategies can be utilized to avoid unnecessary equipment downtime, possible safety hazards, and high turn around time and customer dissatisfaction. 

There are three types of maintenance strategies: 

Preventive maintenance, where parts are replaced at certain set times (e.g, every six months). This may introduce unnecessary costs due to under utilizing the component.

Corrective maintenance, where parts are replaced upon failure. This can introduce costly downtime, safety issue, or harm to other components of machinary.

Predictive maintenance, where a corrective and preventive maintenance meet. This can avoid under-utilization of components while conducting maintenance prior failure.

This project aims to predict remaining useful life of turbofan engine based on failure history using machine learning methods. In order to conduct proper predictive maintenance analysis, it is important to carefully record operational data (including failure conditions) and have sufficient data available to support predictive analysis.
