Significant operational costs can occur as a result of equipment failure. Unnecessary equipment downtime, possible safety hazards caused by non-working machines, and high turn around time which results in customer dissatisfaction can be avoided by proper maintenance strategies.
There are three types of maintenance strategies:
Preventive maintenance, where parts are replaced at certain set times (e.g, every six months). This may introduce unnecessary costs due to under utilizing the component.
Corrective maintenance, where parts are replaced when they fail. This can introduce costly downtimes, safety issues, or harm to other components of the machine.
Predictive maintenance, where a corrective and preventive maintenance meet. This can avoid under-utilization of components while conducting maintenance before failure.
This project aims to predict remaining useful life of turbofan engine based on previous failure data using machine learning methods. In order to conduct proper predictive maintenance analysis, it is important to carefully record historical data (including failure conditions) and that sufficient data is available to support the predictive analysis.
